# A-Railway-Query-Assistant-A-Smart-Machine

## 1. Introduction:
In this project I have implemented a railway query (information) system. All the information are related to train, track, distance, cost, time and schedule. Here I have tried to focus on maintain a good relation among those inter related data. This is going to help a passengers to reach the information in efficient way

## 2.	Problem Domain:

*	Most of the railway stations contain text or notice based information.
*	 Information desk sometimes unable to serve properly. 
*	 Lots of schedule and train name leads to misinformation.
*	 New comers always get trouble to where to ask for information. 
*	 Railway System sometimes failed to provide sufficient information for a particular destination.

## 3.   Objectives:
My objective was to build a system that can continuously provide information system for passengers in a railway station.

## 5.	Users and Target Area
*	All passengers.
*	Everyone who needs train schedule and its related information. 
*	Railway Station, Hospital, Airport, Bus Stop.
*	Any place where arise lots of common query.

## 6.  Tools Used:
*	 Prolog (Programming Language).
*	 SWI-prolog (Prolog Implementation Environment).
*	 Java Swing. 
*	IDE: Netbeans, Notepad++.
